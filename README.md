# ðŸ“Œ GitFlow Project
  This project demonstrates the Git Workflow, specifically GitFlow, through a practical scenario of building a simple calculator application. The development process is divided among three roles:
    1. Senior Developer
    2. Mid-Level Developer
    3. Junior Developer
  Each role follows the GitFlow branching model, handling features, releases, and hotfixes accordingly. The project showcases how teams collaborate efficiently using GitFlow.
